 Bring a Sense of Humor - Our work environment is a lighthearted & optimistic place where employees are united by humor and camaraderie; we believe laughter is a great way to uplift employee morale and form bonds with each other. 
 Collaboration - We won't thrive without recognizing others' strengths. Listen and evolve together, helping and supporting each other for the sake of a collective goal.

 Honor Commitments, Your Word Matters - Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant & Timely (S.M.A.R.T.) Asks & Answers.

"Front End Engineer, Restaurants - New York, NY - Indeed.com","Company Description 
Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place. 
Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together. 
There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same. 
 
 Job Description 
The Restaurants team at Square is reimagining the hospitality industry to empower today's restaurants with simple, elegant software and efficient workflows.

As a front-end engineer on the Restaurants teams, you’ll develop elegant, intuitive, and performance solutions for restaurant owners to use in managing their business. You’ll work closely with your product manager to understand the job that’s trying to be done, consider if and how you should test your product’s success, and build it in a way that maximizes reuse and sharing. In collaboration with other engineers and designers on your team, you’ll iterate based on metrics and customer feedback, and work with other groups across the organization to create the best solutions to our customers’ needs. 
Our team started in NYC, and is now distributed across the US and Canada. We have offices in several major cities for staff who’d like to use them, and our teams operate in a fully distributed fashion. 
What you’ll learn and do: 
You'll create beautiful, unique products that empower anyone to run a restaurant 
You'll design and build products in Square Dashboard, one of the largest Ember.js applications in use anywhere 
You'll work closely and collaboratively with designers, product managers, and other engineers; very often across team boundaries 
You'll ship reliable software through continuous integration, test automation, and in-depth code reviews 
You'll find simple, elegant solutions to hard problems 
You'll grow as an engineer, and as you do you'll lift others around you 
 
 Qualifications 
What you bring to the team and to Square: 
Motivation to build beautiful, intuitive products for the food and drink hospitality industry 
Curiosity, and a desire to learn and teach 
Empathy for your customers and colleagues 
Eagerness to share your own ideas, and openness to those of others 
Experience working in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

Front-End Developer - Remote - Indeed.com,"[REMOTE based out of Atlanta, GA] We are looking for that unique person that can help us build the next generation front-end in React for our SaaS strategy reporting application. 
Can you get spun up quickly? Are you good at working with a team remotely? Do you understand how to write, read, and troubleshoot tests? Are you proficient at CSS? And, most importantly, do you LOVE React Hooks? If so, get in touch. I think we could be friends. 
At ClearPoint, the person who succeeds is not just person who wants to just be told what to do – we’re looking for a creative problem solver with an entrepreneurial spirit who can easily understand business requirements and turn them into code. 
For that reason, people with “nontraditional” (i.e., not CS) backgrounds often thrive here. (Although we love CS majors, too.) Given the size of our team (really small) compared to the size of our client base (growing really fast), we take this stuff very seriously. 
We’re a small team, and we’re going to stay that way, at least for the immediate future, so we’re not looking to hire 10 average people — we’re looking for the one exceptional one. Only candidates who live and work in the USA will be considered. 
Responsibilities 
Converting AngularJS services and components into React hooks and components 
Building front-end tests and ensuring test coverage 
Developing new user-facing features using React.js 
Integrating third party components with main application (Highcharts, etc.) 
Building reusable components and front-end libraries for future use 
Translating designs and wireframes into high quality code 
Skills 
Mastery of React and React Hooks 
Proficiency in CSS, DOM model, aetc. 
Ability to write and troubleshoot unit tests 
Strong proficiency in JavaScript, including DOM manipulation 
Familiarity with newer specifications of EcmaScript 
Familiarity with RESTful APIs 
Familiarity with modern front-end build pipelines and tools 
A knack for benchmarking and optimization 
Familiarity with code versioning tools such as Git 
Desired Experience 
To qualify for this full-time remote position, you’ll need to have a BA or BS, have US work permission, and live in the Eastern time zone (or be ready to shift your schedule to work Eastern US hours). You'll go through an extensive interview process where we’ll ask hard questions about why you want to work here. Come ready to be challenged. 
Interested? 
To be considered, please submit a resume and cover letter highlighting your skills, experience, and interests. Tell us your thinking, strategies, and ideas to advance ClearPoint’s values, unique culture, and vision for the future. The more specific you are in your cover letter and resume, the more likely we are to get back to you. So, read this posting carefully, visit our website, learn about us and what we do, and then apply. 
We may not respond to everyone, but we will look at every application. As busy as we are, we think finding the right person is critical to our success. If we think you could be a match, get ready for a set of phone interviews and then we’ll find a way to meet you in person. We needed someone yesterday, so, if you are great, expect this process to move quickly. 
EEO Statement 
ClearPoint Strategy provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, disability, or genetics.

"Web Front-End Developer - Lafayette, LA 70506 - Indeed.com","Can you handle both? 
 We are looking for a few talented individuals who can design not only beautiful websites, but can also build out those designs on WordPress quickly and efficiently. 
Your mission (should you decide to accept it) will be to design the UI/UX, as well as the actual code that will produce all visual elements of our clients' websites or web applications. Your expertise will help you bridge the gap between graphical design and technical implementation, taking an active role on both sides and defining how the site or application looks as well as how it works. 
Responsibilities? 
 You'll have several. You'll be responsible for designing beautiful but usable designs and interfaces for clients. You'll oversee the recommendation and implementation of WordPress plugins as well as the development of custom user-facing features. You'll create reusable code and assemble libraries for future use. You'll work with our QA team to ensure the technical feasibility of UI/UX designs, and you'll also work with our tech team to optimize any custom applications for maximum speed and scalability. 
To pull this off, you'll need to have a good understanding of Conversion-centric design. We're not about creating designs that entertain the designer. We're about creating designs that convert visitors into customers. So, your expertise in building funnels and website conversion opportunities will be critical to the success of our clients. 
You need to be a team player who is passionate about learning, teaching, serving, and growing. This industry changes fast, so if you like change, strap on and hold tight, because we push change to its maximum every day. 
Skills And Qualifications 
 You definitely need to know your way around Photoshop and Illustrator, plus you'll need to know how to build a WordPress site with as little custom CSS as possible. The goal is to leverage the power that is built into WordPress and not build every page independently of the CMS. When it comes time to make a site or application really sing, though, you'll need to demonstrate your proficient understanding of web markup, including HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, and JavaScript. 
Ideally, you'd have a great understanding of designing using Thrive Architect, Divi, or WP Bakery. You'll also need a good understanding of SEO principles and ensure that our clients' websites will adhere to them. 
Oh, and you'll not only need to be creative, but you're going to need to be fast. We have the need for speed at Bizzuka, because our clients depend on us to help them increase revenues and decrease expenses by automating lead generation or automating manual processes. The sooner we fix their problems, the more of an impact we can have on their business and the customers they serve. 
Our clients expect and deserve the best. If that sounds like something you can get behind, then attach your resume with a link to your portfolio of work."

You have at least 1-2 years of your developer journey completed, and the most important thing to you about a new job is being surrounded by smart people. You’ve worked on the same project long enough that you’re disappointed with a feature you built months ago (you can build it better now). You're always looking for ways to improve the user experience with design and functionality. You think asking questions or saying, “I don’t know” is a strength, not a weakness. You’re wildly talented and can’t wait to share the knowledge you have or new tech you learned over a weekend. You know Git, or at least you know how to pull, commit, fork and branch. Collaboration is of utmost importance You dabble in WordPress theme-ing or are a WordPress Developer. You know Magento isn’t a color and aren’t afraid of XML layouts. Development is a craft you are learning and hope to perform daily with integrity. Good simply isn’t good enough. How did you know? That’s me! Fantastic. Here’s a bit more about the job. About the Job Work with various development teams across the nation - and sometimes overseas - to develop harder working websites using HTML, Sass and JS. Work with MVC Frameworks in both PHP and .NET programming languages. Use and develop for platforms like WordPress, Shopify, Kentico, nopCommerce, Magento and sometimes custom tailored CMSs. All code you write will be tracked with Git and you’ll be responsible for your part in a feature-branch workflow. For platforms like Kentico and WordPress, you will support backend teams in developing plugins or extensions to fit project requirements. You’ll use Figma and Adobe Suite to edit/modify/optimize images and break apart PSD designs into HTML/CSS/JS and integrate with aforementioned frameworks. Your day-to-day will include working on multiple client projects at a time. Some from scratch and others from existing projects that need maintenance or feature updates. You will manage your own tasks and queue of work given to you by the project management team or customer support. You’ll estimate work, brainstorming strategy, and creating proof-of-concepts for new business. GoldenComm is all for sharing knowledge.

"Front End Engineer, Restaurants - New York, NY - Indeed.com","Company Description 
Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place. 
Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together. 
There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same. 
 
 Job Description 
The Restaurants team at Square is reimagining the hospitality industry to empower today's restaurants with simple, elegant software and efficient workflows. Restaurants today operate in an increasingly dynamic landscape, and we're building a modern product ecosystem to support this by using technology to unlock new workflows, revenue streams, and means of communication. Our focus is on efficiency, automation, and reliability: themes of paramount importance in a fast-paced environment where great hospitality is key. 
As a front-end engineer on the Restaurants teams, you’ll develop elegant, intuitive, and performance solutions for restaurant owners to use in managing their business. You’ll work closely with your product manager to understand the job that’s trying to be done, consider if and how you should test your product’s success, and build it in a way that maximizes reuse and sharing. In collaboration with other engineers and designers on your team, you’ll iterate based on metrics and customer feedback, and work with other groups across the organization to create the best solutions to our customers’ needs. 
Our team started in NYC, and is now distributed across the US and Canada. We have offices in several major cities for staff who’d like to use them, and our teams operate in a fully distributed fashion. 
What you’ll learn and do: 
You'll create beautiful, unique products that empower anyone to run a restaurant 
You'll design and build products in Square Dashboard, one of the largest Ember.js applications in use anywhere 
You'll work closely and collaboratively with designers, product managers, and other engineers; very often across team boundaries 
You'll ship reliable software through continuous integration, test automation, and in-depth code reviews 
You'll find simple, elegant solutions to hard problems 
You'll grow as an engineer, and as you do you'll lift others around you 
 
 Qualifications 
What you bring to the team and to Square: 
Motivation to build beautiful, intuitive products for the food and drink hospitality industry 
Curiosity, and a desire to learn and teach 
Empathy for your customers and colleagues 
Eagerness to share your own ideas, and openness to those of others 
Experience working in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS 
Experience with modern JavaScript frameworks a benefit, but not a requirement 
Familiarity with back end technologies a bonus (we use Java, Ruby, and Go) 
Technologies we use and teach: 
ES6 JavaScript 
Ember JS 
SCSS

"Web Front-End Developer - Lafayette, LA 70506 - Indeed.com","Can you handle both? 
 We are looking for a few talented individuals who can design not only beautiful websites, but can also build out those designs on WordPress quickly and efficiently. 
Your mission (should you decide to accept it) will be to design the UI/UX, as well as the actual code that will produce all visual elements of our clients' websites or web applications. Your expertise will help you bridge the gap between graphical design and technical implementation, taking an active role on both sides and defining how the site or application looks as well as how it works. 
Responsibilities? 
 You'll have several. You'll be responsible for designing beautiful but usable designs and interfaces for clients. You'll oversee the recommendation and implementation of WordPress plugins as well as the development of custom user-facing features. You'll create reusable code and assemble libraries for future use. You'll work with our QA team to ensure the technical feasibility of UI/UX designs, and you'll also work with our tech team to optimize any custom applications for maximum speed and scalability. 
To pull this off, you'll need to have a good understanding of Conversion-centric design. We're not about creating designs that entertain the designer. We're about creating designs that convert visitors into customers. So, your expertise in building funnels and website conversion opportunities will be critical to the success of our clients. 
You need to be a team player who is passionate about learning, teaching, serving, and growing. This industry changes fast, so if you like change, strap on and hold tight, because we push change to its maximum every day. 
Skills And Qualifications 
 You definitely need to know your way around Photoshop and Illustrator, plus you'll need to know how to build a WordPress site with as little custom CSS as possible. The goal is to leverage the power that is built into WordPress and not build every page independently of the CMS. When it comes time to make a site or application really sing, though, you'll need to demonstrate your proficient understanding of web markup, including HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, and JavaScript. 
Ideally, you'd have a great understanding of designing using Thrive Architect, Divi, or WP Bakery. You'll also need a good understanding of SEO principles and ensure that our clients' websites will adhere to them. 
Oh, and you'll not only need to be creative, but you're going to need to be fast. We have the need for speed at Bizzuka, because our clients depend on us to help them increase revenues and decrease expenses by automating lead generation or automating manual processes. The sooner we fix their problems, the more of an impact we can have on their business and the customers they serve. 
Our clients expect and deserve the best. If that sounds like something you can get behind, then attach your resume with a link to your portfolio of work."

FINE Reviews 
 
“I’ve worked on multiple projects building sites for everything from wineries to private equity clients. There’s always an interesting new feature or challenge to overcome with each project, and our designers always bring fresh ideas to the table. Part of a successful build is coming up with ways to create flexible object-oriented data models without over-engineering too much complexity into it so that sites can evolve and change with the client’s needs over time.“  — Jeremy Clemans, Developer 
“FINE offers the perfect balance of a humanity-first approach to business and envelope-pushing aspirations. It’s the harmony between the two that’s continually impressed me and inspired me to want to give back not just through my work ethic but in my desire to help see the business thrive. Leadership consistently exemplifies a deep consideration and care for the team, especially in their rallying for self-advocacy and continued personal growth – which can certainly be advertised by any agency, but to actually follow through requires a real level of trust and commitment.“ —  Mehran Azma, Associate Creative Director

"Front-End Engineer - London, OR - Indeed.com","Our Mission 
 
Novus serves capital allocators and managers, helping them enrich and manage their data, extract actionable investment insights, and improve stakeholder communication via visualization and automation. We strive to be the center of the institutional investment ecosystem, where the world’s investors gather to manage their portfolios and engage with one another. 
 
Over $120 trillion is invested annually on behalf of pensions, endowments, sovereign funds, private investors, and family offices. Unfortunately, many of these institutions are using outdated and disconnected tools to manage their portfolios. Novus offers comprehensive solutions for multi-asset class portfolios. By providing a single platform that streamlines data processes, quantifies investment skill, uncovers bias, and helps investors plan more accurately, we are helping investors amplify their impact. 
 
Our Values 
 
If the following sounds like you, we look forward to getting to know you — 
 
 You are looking to join a fast-paced team that will mentor and support you as you take on challenging projects. 
 You understand that deadlines and goals – even if self-imposed – are what help businesses succeed. 
 You appreciate direct, unvarnished feedback – you know it will help you grow. 
 
 Also: 
 
 The thought of deploying code to production several times day excites you. You know it is better to ""fail fast"" than to never ship at all. 
 You enjoy mastering your craft, but also love learning about technologies and tools outside your core expertise. 
 You don't take yourself too seriously and know the importance of bringing some levity to an otherwise tense situation. 
 
 
What You’ll Do 
 
You’ll join our Product Team as a Front-End Engineer (HTML/JavaScript) developing the core Novus product, Alpha Platform. This role will expose you to our rapidly evolving product suite, with consistent opportunity to make a direct impact on the business. 
 
Novus is a small firm, so we need our engineers to take ownership of their projects. You’ll do more than merely “code to a wireframe.” From the start, you’ll be helping bring products from concept to production while solving distinct design, UI and UX challenges. 
 
Some responsibilities will include: 
 
 Become an expert in our front-end stack 
 Learn about our backend stack, coded in Scala, MySQL and AWS technologies. 
 Collaborate across the entire organization, including backend engineers, data operations team, client services and product managers. 
 Develop expertise in a broad array of financial topics. 
 
 Critical Skills / Abilities 
 
Our ideal candidate has at least 2 years professional experience building applications in HTML5 and JavaScript and experience with 
 
 Web frameworks such as Angular or React 
 Web application layout and design using a CSS preprocessor (Sass, Stylus), and a templating language (Pug, Mustache) 
 Continuous Delivery, including integration testing with tools such as Cypress or Selenium 
 
 Additional skills that we would love to see but are not required: 
 
 Hands-on experience with backend technologies, specifically Java, Scala, or SQL 
 Familiarity Node.js and/or Puppeteer 
 Personal interest in capital markets, finance and investing (even if you’ve never traded stock)."

"Front End Developer - Reston, VA - Indeed.com","Ring.io is on a mission to empower sales teams with software weapons. Every sales team is at war with other sales teams in their industry. Our apps give sales pros an unfair advantage. 
 We specialize in communication and engagement software. Our killer app is a CRM-embedded dialer that helps sales reps and managers drive interactions with prospects. 
 Just like an exoskeleton increases a soldier's range and ability to carry gear, Ring.io augments a sales rep's ability to develop many more parallel shallow relationships. 
 That's today. Tomorrow, what weapons will sales teams need? 
 The thread that weaves together everything we do is a passion for translating hard core tech and usability R&D into software innovations that solve practical problems in a powerful way, and that professionals fall in love with. 
 The team behind Ring.io is made of intelligent, collegial and curious people. We believe in solving hard problems once and for all. We believe that a few, focused, fast learners who trust each other can make a big difference. 
 About the Position… 
 Ring.io has been delivering world-class software as a service for over a decade. Our engineering team is made of a small group of high-caliber, collaborative engineers. 
 This is the perfect role for an Software engineer who's ready for a role where their potential to learn and grow is unlimited by the usual blockers: 
 If you've ever been asked to support a crummy or old tech stack, you know how demoralizing it can be to see your hours slip away fixing the unfixable. 
 If you've been stuck being the junior person on a team that has no time for you and doesn't trust you, you know how tough it is to wake up every day and try to fake enthusiasm about the meaningless projects you've been assigned. 
 In contrast, the Ring.io team is small, you have direct access to over 50 man-years of engineering talent, and we don't waste time doing meaningless work. You will be able to trace directly what you do to customer impact. Every project you work on will be an amazing learning experience that will grow your skills. 
 If you're still excited after reading that, then let's get to the details 
 Ring.io is seeking an Front End Engineer that is passionate about building mobile and desktop web applications 
 Your responsibilities: 
 Architect efficient and reusable front-end systems that drive complex web applications 
Collaborate with Product Designers, Product Managers, and Software Engineers to deliver compelling user-facing products 
Identify and resolve performance and scalability issues. 
 We need someone with... 
 Proficiency in real-time interactive systems and event-driven programming 
Solid background in RESTful Web Services 
2+ years of JavaScript experience, including concepts like asynchronous programming, closures, types, and ES6 
2+ years of HTML/CSS experience, including concepts like layout, specificity, cross browser compatibility, and accessibility 
2+ years experience with browser APIs and optimizing front end performance 
Experience with React & TypeScript is a plus 
Knowledge of building Chrome extensions using Javascript is a big plus 
Knowledge of the Node.js/npm ecosystem 
At least 4 hours of daily overlap with US Eastern Time. 
 What it's like to work at Ring.io 
 We love coming to work every day 
Each employee has the freedom to make an impact on the business 
Everybody is dying to help you, has a genuine interest in your ideas, and wants to learn from you 
Everybody understands that each team member plays a vital role in advancing the business 
Nobody cares how you dress - you should be comfortable 
We hate meetings 
We like Macs and big computer screens

 We are a 100% remote company and this is a 100% remote position. You work from wherever you live. Our expectation is that you have or will have a quiet, comfortable and well-connected spot from which you'll be available to do the work. We can help you get what you need to have an effective home office. You'll have less interaction than if you worked in an office, but less distractions too. 
Our business hours are US East Coast hours - you will need to have a large overlap of hours in your workday during those hours to meet and communicate with customers. Most of our customers are based in North America. While technically possible, it is unlikely that we would work with you if all your daytime hours are all of our customer and team member nighttime hours & vice versa.

Competitive base salary. 
You participate in the Ring.io Team Bonus Plan 
If you plan to stay with us for the long term, you will be eligible to get stock options.

"front-end engineer - Austin, TX - Indeed.com","hi there, thanks for stopping by. 
 What follows is a bit lengthy, but will give you a better idea of what we do, what this role entails and how to apply. 
 what we do 
 We're a boutique growth agency that gives a damn about our work, our clients, our people, and doing the right thing. We specialize in: 
 user experience research and design 
full-service a/b testing and personalization (aka conversion rate optimization) 
data analytics 
email 
 about your role and team 
 If you would rather feel trusted to use your expertise and problem-solve than have your manager hawking over your shoulder micromanaging you, keep reading! Here at surefoot, we hire smart, entrepreneurially-minded folks and get out of their way so they have the space to deliver real value to our clients. Leave the wasted time, infighting and red tape to someone else. You didn't become a developer to deal with that stress mess day in and day out! 
 As an engineer at surefoot, you'll work closely with product managers, project managers, designers and QA to build tests the team has prioritized for e-commerce clients like Hydro Flask, Peak Design, OXO, Made In and others. This is a unique front-end role, as you'll be writing code that is inserted into websites via 3rd party testing tools like Dynamic Yield, Convert or Google Optimize. Ethical hacking, of sorts. Something important we want you to know ahead of time is that this job is a bit different than your standard front-end gig. You won't be working on a single app or feature for several months. Instead, you'll be writing smaller chunks of code on a lot of different projects for a variety of clients. One day it could be an exit intent modal, the next could be restructuring a nav – the possibilities are endless. Your code will sometimes (often) be part of a losing test and never see the light of production, which is one reason we value efficiency over perfect, beautiful code. 
 Internally, you'll enjoy collaborating with kind, supportive co-workers who respect you and your time – both at and away from the virtual office. You'll be recognized by peers, leadership and clients for your curiosity and attention to detail, which are critical to your success. In fact, “do the bare minimum”, dependent personalities don't last long here. Nor do people with “that's not in my job description” attitudes. When smart people collaborate instead of compete and bring solutions instead of problems, amazing things happen. 
 Speaking of collaboration, that's something you'll occasionally do with our clients. We bend over backwards (but not forwards) to make sure they're happy. Our goal is to be the best, most helpful agency they've ever worked with. To help us achieve that goal, we encourage you to share and celebrate your authentic self day in-and-day-out with co-workers and clients alike. Even if it means letting your “weird” show every once in awhile. 
 We'll be honest; surefoot isn't for everyone. We encourage and expect you to use your expertise, make decisions without a lot of oversight, go above and beyond to help a teammate or client, spend time to thoughtfully communicate asynchronously, and manage your own work schedule. If you're a humble team player who likes to see and contribute to the success of something greater than yourself, then we want you to apply. Now. 
 a day in the life of a front-end engineer 
 start your morning with a cup o' joe and fire up your computer to check emails, Slack and Asana. 
it's 10:30am CST, time for our team Zoom stand-up to chit chat with teammates a bit, then talk through your priorities for the day and any blockers. 
shortly after stand-up, you begin working on the big test in your queue – a navigation redesign for mobile and desktop devices. 
once you've added the necessary events and configured the test in the testing tool, you'll pass it off to QA and take a break to refill your coffee or participate in some witty banter (complete with GIFs and custom emojis) in #watercooler. 
as the day nears it's end, you'll patch a few bugs identified in QA, send the test to the strategic director for review and answer a few questions in Asana from your teammates about test details. 
it's the first Wednesday of the month, so grab your beverage of choice and wrap up the day with the team at a Zoom virtual happy hour!

 ready to apply? 
 Since we are a fully remote team, we have a somewhat atypical interview process. For the first step of the interview phase, we ask applicants to show basic competency in the necessary skill sets (don't worry, no hazing a la “live code fizzbuzz” is involved). 
 If all is well there, you'll move on to phase two which involves a Zoom video call to get to know one another a bit better. If we're feeling good about that, we'll contact your references. 
 And finally, if your references check out and confirm you're not a stabber, we'll ask you to do some actual paid work with us to determine fit for both parties. 
 To apply, please fill out our application form and be ready to submit a link to your code from this exercise (https://github.com/surefootme/Surefoot-Front-End-Engineer-Exercise/blob/master/0-intro.md).

 All applicants will receive a response. We know through experience that different ideas, perspectives and backgrounds foster a stronger and more creative work environment that delivers better business results. We strive to create workplaces that reflect the clients we serve and where everyone feels empowered to bring their full, authentic selves to work. We are an equal opportunity employer and we are committed to building a company that embraces and celebrates diversity and inclusion. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We are also committed to working with candidates from all ability levels throughout the recruitment process to ensure they have what they need to be at their best.

 JavaScript Developer 
 
Our culture has been described as “high-performance and low ego.” We’re seeking a high-performance JavaScript developer that is eager to collaborate with leaders in all aspects of the technology stack to build better web experiences for our clients. ONeil Interactive’s development staff is a team of nine. The JavaScript Developer is a new role. It’s a critical part of our future and a role we’re seeking to fill immediately. 
 
If the following statements describe you, we’d love to talk. 
 
 jQuery makes you sad. Console errors make you very sad. 
 You appreciate how jQuery has helped introduce many developers to what’s possible with JavaScript, but now you want to show them a better way. 
 You respect the power of JavaScript while recognizing it’s not the only tool, and not always the best tool, for a task. 
 Micro-optimizations make you happy. 
 You measure the value of code by its positive impact on application performance and its ease of maintenance. 
 You believe code documentation is as helpful for the author as it is for other users. 
 You are good-natured and collaborative. You want to work together with other good people to build great things. 
 You provide and receive constructive feedback gracefully. 
 Seeing your libraries used by others is a great source of pride and satisfaction.

Our clients depend on Homefiniti to run their business. By meeting our responsibility to our clients, every home we help them sell equates to a full year of employment for a tradesperson. And through this success, we have shared our profits with donations to dozens of charitable organizations supporting youth education in technology and other worthy causes. 
 
The technical skills for our JavaScript developer include: 
 
 An expertise is one or more JS frameworks such as Vue or React. We don’t have a favorite, but understanding where these libraries add value, or not, is critical. 
 Skilled in native ES5 & ES6, the browser support for each, and how to determine the best choice for the task. 
 Builds efficient and reusable libraries that enable less skilled JavaScript developers to implement advanced features and functionality. 
 Writes robust logical documentation that assists other developers. 
 
 What types of projects will the ONeil Interactive JavaScript Developer will work on? 
 
 Projects that will make the biggest difference in the performance of Homefiniti and the client websites it powers. 
 Creation of a global DOM management tool, or the incorporation of an existing library if a suitable one exists. 
 Creating new, or refactoring existing, libraries that manage tasks that include AJAX requests, cookie management, analytics, form nonces, DOM manipulation, and interacting with external APIs such as Google Maps, Mapbox, YouTube, Vimeo, and the Facebook Marketing API."

Software Engineer - Front End - Washington State - Indeed.com,"About Us : 
 
Common Room brings companies closer to their communities. Today's most successful companies are driven by thriving communities of end users. As a result, companies of all sizes are investing in their communities, but software hasn't caught up yet. Until now. We're building the first community intelligence platform that identifies the people, topics, and organizations that matter most. With Common Room, teams can finally realize the true potential of their communities and build stronger relationships with their users than ever before. 
 
We've raised over $50 million from top-tier investors including Greylock, Index, and Madrona to build the community platform for modern SaaS companies. Additionally, we're backed by 25+ operators from community-first organizations such as Figma, Stripe, Airtable, Slack, Notion, Loom, and more. 
 
You + Common Room? You'd be joining a team that revels in asking hard questions, collaborating gladly, and making decisions quickly—a team that values simplicity, passion, trust, each other, and our customers above all. 
 
So hello! Please, knock on our door. We'd love to meet you. 
 
Why we need you: 
 
Your focus on user-facing experiences, and ability to collaborate with engineers, PMs and designers, are your superpower. Your React/CSS/HTML/TypeScript expertise allow you to rapidly convert design mocks into functional code. You build delightful, pixel-perfect user experiences which are snappy, and sweat the details on performance. You build maintainable, well-componentized code that other engineers can work with. 
 
Outside of this, you also identify and participate in important company-building initiatives that a fast growing startup needs. 
 
You would enjoy being a member of our team if you: 
 
 Have 5+ years of experience, or consider yourself either a stable anchor or an untapped genius ready to flourish 
 Revel in your craft, are excited by and capable of owning large projects primarily in the front-end domain 
 Collaborate effectively with other experienced engineers, but especially designers and PMs 
 Are experienced with building at startup speed, or excited to experience and embrace it 
 Are capable of making high quality technical and non-technical tradeoffs 
 Prefer well supported, stable technologies over trendy/fashionable tech, even in the fast-moving world of front-end frameworks 
 You sweat the details on matching designed product specs, and think of performance, componentization, and testability as core requirements of building a great front-end experience for customers 
 Bring your authentic self to work, and engage in candid + respectful feedback 
 Build sustainably, and are capable of managing your time and priorities as best suits your needs 
 Enjoy the journey as much as the destination, but never lose sight of the destination 
 Demonstrate pride, ownership, and accountability for your work, and expect the same from those you work with 
 
 Our current tech stack : 
 
We choose tools that help solve the problem at hand efficiently. For our current set of problems, we prefer to primarily use  TypeScript  with  Node.js.

We use  React  for front-end, and  AWS  for our infrastructure needs. 
 
Our values : 
 
 Be Customer-centric -  We work backwards from the needs of our customers. The crisp articulation of customer value guides our decisions. 
 Strive for Simplicity -  We choose simplicity over complexity whenever possible. We seek to identify and understand the essential quality of what we are building. 
 Craft Excellence -  We take pride in our craft and are relentless in our pursuit of excellence. But we also know real artists ship. 
 We're In this Together -  We measure personal success by the success of our customers and teammates. Relationships matter, and the strongest ones are built on the foundations of trust, enablement, and transparency. 
 
 Our benefits : 
 
Our investment in caring for our employees and their families is a key part of our values and culture at Common Room:

"Senior Front End Engineer - New York, NY 10012 - Indeed.com","Why Build Lido? The average company uses over 80 SaaS applications, and nearly 10% of companies use over 200 different pieces of software. These different systems never fully work together in the exact way their users want them to. Every user, manager, and company is a little unique, and to solve their problems their software needs to be a little unique as well. What Is Lido? Lido is a spreadsheet that non-programmers can use to build their own software. Unlike existing spreadsheets, we integrate directly into everywhere a company's data is created and everywhere it needs to go in real-time. This allows end-users to define business logic with the spreadsheet formulas they already know and to automate manual, tedious processes end-to-end. Why Spreadsheets? Spreadsheets are the backbone of a business. They allow every person within an organization to work with data, find insights, and automate repetitive workflows. Nearly 40 years after their invention, spreadsheets remain the only way 96% of people can define custom tasks for the computer to execute. As powerful as they are, spreadsheets haven't been adapted for this day and age.

"Web Developer - Ogden, UT 84404 - Indeed.com","About Kadince 
Kadince (pronounced cadence) is a fully remote software company founded in 2013. In a nutshell, we build tools to help financial institutions track and manage the good they do in their communities. 
Kadince has been profitable for several years (we’re fans of making more than we spend). We’re bootstrapped, which means we don’t have investors. So our owners answer to no one. And they aren’t just giving us commands from their vacation homes waiting to cash their next check. They’re fellow team members and in the trenches with us. 
Why We’re Hiring 
After our team members, our customers are our most important focus. As our customer base grows, so does our team. We’re dedicated to giving each customer the best experience possible, which means having enough people to take care of all their needs. We’re growing quickly and so are the needs of our customers. That’s why we’re increasing the size of our development team. 
Who We Want to Hire 
To be a web developer at Kadince you should have 5+ years of experience. This experience has given you an understanding of basic database driven web applications and a proficient knowledge of the MVC pattern. You understand that software development is  all  about the end-user (again, we really care about our customers). 
You have a desire to continually learn and improve your development skills. We love giving team members opportunities to improve their skills, whether through online courses, workshops, or learning from others. 
You’re able to adapt quickly to new environments, are organized and focused, can look beyond current constraints (you know, forest through the trees), and can provide solutions to complex problems. Simply put, we need a problem solver, not a taskmaster. 
Our vision, mission, and core values should resonate with you. That’ll be crucial to your success and happiness if you join the Kadince team. 
Let’s Geek Out 
If you’re geeky like our dev team (hopefully you are), you probably want to know more about our tech-stack. Outside of our dev team, we’re not really sure what most of this means, but we sure hope you do.

Our Vision and Mission 
Our vision and mission aren’t something we hung on the office wall and forgot about. Seriously, we don’t have an office, let alone a wall to hang them on. But our vision, mission, and core values sit on the desks of each of our team members. And we discuss them regularly in our meetings. Your goals (KPIs) will be developed to ensure you’re working to help us achieve our vision and mission. 
Our vision and mission are what get us up each morning. They, in addition to our core values, help us make decisions. 
Vision -  Setting the standard for operating a great software company. 
We’re big fans of author Jim Collins and his best-selling book,  Good to Great  (bonus points if you’ve read it). While there are lots of good software companies out there, we want to be one of the great ones. 
The first word of our vision is also significant. To go “high school English class” on you, the present participle “setting” illustrates that we’re  not  looking to set the standard and then be done, but that the standard is always moving and we’re always chasing it. We continually stop to recognize the awesome things we’ve done and then look for ways to do them even better. 
Mission  - Building the best community involvement software for financial institutions™. 
As Jim Collins taught in his Hedgehog Concept (told you we think he’s great—pun intended), great companies need to determine what they can be the best at in the world and focus on that. There are so many things we could solve as a software company, but we’ve found what we think we can be the best in the world at and we stick to it every day. 
Our Core Values 
Our core values remind us who we are. They also guide us in the decisions we make. They’re listed in order of importance. If we have a question when making a decision about people, for example, we look to the core value above it to make our decision. 
 
Integrity - We’re honest with ourselves and others. 
 People - We understand that people are the foundation of Kadince and we act accordingly. 
 Care - We love what we do and do it consistently and intentionally to the best of our abilities. 
 Remarkability - We provide remarkable experiences to all who come into contact with Kadince. 
 Growth - We accept yesterday and improve today. 
 
 
What a Day in the Life of a Web Developer Looks Like 
Your day starts with a development team meeting where you go through announcements, sync up projects, and discuss any potential issues. After the meeting, you put your head down and work on your assigned tickets in Jira. 
You spend the first part of the day reviewing your notes and prioritizing tasks for the junior developers. You make sure that you and the other developers are working on the most important tasks first, but you’re free to choose which ones you work on. 
For lunch, you meet a friend at the cafe near his work. You haven’t seen your friend for a few months, so you talk about life and your careers. You can’t help but feel very lucky for the freedom you have to take a long lunch break and meet your friend, as he has to hurry back to the office and get working right at the hour. 
Back at home, you continue working on tickets in Jira. At one point a junior web developer calls you on Slack and asks how to fix an issue. You expertly show him the process and he thanks you for being so helpful. 
You notice that another developer has been really on top of it today, so you mention them in the company Slack channel and thank them for being so awesome. Many of your team members respond to your shoutout with party emojis and hearts. 
In the afternoon your team has a standup meeting where you discuss what projects you’re all working on and whether there’s anything anyone can do to help. Your leader points out one of the awesome projects you’re working on and thanks you for being so attentive to the users’ needs. 
After the standup you do some QA and manually test a couple of the changes your team made today. You write automated tests to ensure the functionality that was just worked on. You find one little bug, you log it and then fix it easily. 
You finish up your day by taking a look at tomorrow’s schedule and planning accordingly. 
When and Where You’d Work and What You’d Work On 
Kadince is a principle-based company, which means we focus on principles, not policies. Since we’re a fully remote company, you’ll speak with Aaron Venezia, your leader, to determine when and where you’ll work. You’ll also work with your leader each week, month, quarter, and year to determine your goals (your KPIs or key performance indicators) and what you’ll work on. 
The principle is to work when and where you want as long as you meet or exceed your KPIs. This may mean planning your day around team meetings or working a longer day because you’ll be out of the office for the next week. Overall, your schedule needs to help you achieve our vision and mission and demonstrate our core values. 
At Kadince, work won’t tie you down to one location. You’ll be free to travel or relocate as you get the itch to try somewhere new. Want to spend a month abroad, working from a hotel and exploring the rest of the time? Go ahead. Just make sure you have a reliable high-speed internet connection (as if you would go anywhere without it anyway) and turn on the blurry filter during video calls so we don’t get jealous. We seriously get jealous. One of our teammates recently had zebras running around in the background of a video call during a team meeting. Come to find out he was working from the deck of his hotel at the Animal Kingdom in Disney World. Even though we were jealous, we thought it was pretty cool. 
Who You’d Be Working With 
We have over 30 team members (which makes us really happy since Kadince was started by two people in their basements). If hired, you’ll probably work with each team member in one way or another. Some of the people you’ll work with most frequently are: 
Aaron  makes sure that Kadince software runs smoothly and that any problems are addressed quickly and efficiently. When it comes to software wizards, he’s the Dumbledore of web developers (but really, he wishes he was Voldemort). He’s been here since nearly the beginning of Kadince, so he’s seen it all. Aaron loves to go skiing and mountain biking, as well as play video games and pinball (can you beat him?). He’s very proud of the fact that he’s his tiny dog’s favorite person, and he has a strange passion for curly fries. 
Bernardo  (better known around here as Beans) has been a web developer at Kadince since 2014. He’s originally from Chile, but has lived in Utah since he was 12. He loves to code, play video games, spend time with his wife, kids, and dogs. He also loves to learn new things. If he could do anything in the world he would go to space (although technically that’s not in this world, now is it?). 
Luis  is a junior web developer and has worked for Kadince since 2019. He likes to hike, run, and be outdoors. Luis is fun and gets along with everyone, so feel free to joke around and have a good time. Just don’t play Rocket League with him. He WILL beat you. Actually, do play, lots of the other developers do. And if you’re lucky, he might share his grandma’s tamales with you. 
Benefits 
Since we’re a remote company, we don’t offer office snacks and ping pong tables. But if you’re a fan of “core benefits” that bring great rewards and peace of mind, you’ll like what we have to offer. Competitive pay, 401(k) matching, generous paid leave, insurance (medical, dental, vision, life, short-term disability), a flex spending account, and profit sharing. Yeah, it’s pretty great... 
And we love to spoil our team. We celebrate big events with you, like birthdays and work anniversaries, so you can expect some pretty fun gifts. We recently sent some high-quality lip balm to each team member so we could all play a prank on Scott, our Director of Product. We’re fun like that. And this year we’re giving every team member the last week of the year off (we like to spread holiday cheer). 
Every year, we go on a super fun retreat as a team. This isn’t your typical conference room and endless meetings shindig. We spend about 5 days getting to know each other and doing fun activities in a cool place. Next year we’ll be at a resort in St. George, Utah (have you seen High School Musical 2?). Where will we go next? 
How to Apply 
Applicants who stand out are those who are interested in working for Kadince, not just applying for as many positions as possible or trying to keep unemployment benefits. We’ve seen it all. No kidding, we once had someone ask us in an interview what the name of our company is. Needless to say, we could tell that person wasn’t really passionate about joining our team. 
When applying to Kadince, please send us a PDF of your resume. The questions below are your opportunity to tell us why you would be a great fit for the position. Take advantage of this time. Seriously, sell yourself! 
Thank you for your interest in Kadince. We look forward to reviewing your application.
