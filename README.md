## General Information

For this project, I build an python program which scrape the job from Indeed.

## Language and Modules

- Python 3.8.3
- nltk 3.5
- scikit-learn 1.0.1
- BeautifulSoup 4.9.1
- wordcloud 1.8.1
- pandas 1.0.5
- matplotlib 3.2.2

## Setup

1. In order to use this code to its full extent, ensure you have the required libraries installed, you can do this through pip and python by running

> $ pip install nltk

> $ pip install beautifulsoup4

> $ pip install wordcloud

> $ pip install pandas

> $ pip install matplotlib

3. In order to run the scraper you have to install [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) or VSCode have jupyter notebook extension as well, use the following command from within the project main directory.

## Possible Improvements

- Improve all overall quality of code in the program
- Use spacy library to train a model to find soft and hard/technical skills
- Generalize the code. So, anyone can scrape indeed for the desired job at any location.
- Improve the analysis part
