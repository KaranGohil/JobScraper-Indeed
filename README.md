## General Information

For this project, I build an python program which scrape the job from Indeed.

The indeed scraper is in "jobScraper.ipynb"

The Report is in "Report.ipynb"

More info on how to use the scraper is inside the jupyter notebook!

## Language and Modules

- Python 3.8.3
- nltk 3.5
- scikit-learn 1.0.1
- BeautifulSoup 4.9.1
- wordcloud 1.8.1
- pandas 1.0.5
- matplotlib 3.2.2

## Setup

1. In order to use this code to its full extent, ensure you have the required libraries installed, you can do this through pip and python by running

> $ pip install nltk

> $ pip install beautifulsoup4

> $ pip install wordcloud

> $ pip install pandas

> $ pip install matplotlib

> $ pip install scikit-learn 

3. In order to run the scraper you have to install [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) or VSCode have jupyter notebook extension as well, use the following command from within the project main directory.

## Possible Improvements

- Improve all overall quality of code in the program
- Use spacy library to train a model to find soft and hard/technical skills
- Generalize the code. So, anyone can scrape indeed for the desired job at any location.
- Improve the analysis part
