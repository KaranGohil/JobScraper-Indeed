The MGH Center for Immunology and Inflammatory Diseases (CIID) is looking for exceptional computational biologist candidates to join the Single Cell Genomics Research Program directed by Dr. Alexandra-Chloé Villani. This multidisciplinary research program focuses on developing and implementing systems immunology and genomics strategies to further our understanding of the human immune system. The Villani laboratory is also affiliated to the Broad Institute of MIT & Harvard, offering additional opportunities to collaborate and bridge with this vibrant community. 
 This position offers the opportunity to employ the cutting-edge of computational biology, machine learning and statistical research to solve important problems in health and disease related to the human immune system, autoimmune diseases and cancer. Single cell genomics is revolutionizing our understanding of biology – from redefining our understanding of the types of cells, a fundamental unit in biology, to translating this knowledge to better understand disease phenotypes and the implications of this to therapeutics. We are looking for a highly motivated and talented individual with a computational background to join our efforts. This position represents an exciting opportunity to work as a member of an interdisciplinary team of biologists, laboratory scientists, computational biologists, and physicians working together on transformative translational efforts that are bridging between the clinical and research interfaces. Our research program is developing and implementing unbiased experimental and computational strategies that can directly survey the human immune system in order to define at high resolution the key processes and players underlying healthy human immune responses as a foundation for understanding how immunity is dysregulated in diseases. This includes establishing a more comprehensive roadmap of the human immune system through identifying novel immune cell subpopulations across tissues using single-cell ‘omics’ strategies along with mapping the cellular ecosystem and associated molecular circuitry driving immune diseases. Collectively, our research program is empowering the study of the human immune system as a function of “healthy” baseline, inflammatory state, disease progression, and response to treatment with emphasis on precision medicine, ultimately paving the way for developing a comprehensive human immune lexicon that is key to promoting effective bench-to-beside translation of findings.
 As part of this position, you will conceive and apply algorithms as well as analytical approaches to analyze single-cell RNA/DNA/protein/ATAC-sequencing sequencing data generated from a wide-range of human tissue and immune-related disease conditions. The candidates will also take the lead on performing a wide range single-cell multi-omics analyses and collaborate directly with scientists performing experimental research studies at the bench and physicians seeing the patients. You must be capable of working in an interactive team environment while conducting self-directed research within broader goals set by group.

CGI Group Inc., more commonly known as CGI, is a Canadian global information technology (IT) consulting, systems integration, outsourcing, and solutions[buzzword] company headquartered in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. In 1976, Serge Godin and André Imbeau founded CGI, which originally stood for “Conseillers en gestion et informatique” (translating to “Consultants in management and information technology”). After starting out as an IT consulting firm, the company soon began branching into new markets and acquiring other companies. CGI went public in 1986 with a primary listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange. CGI is also a constituent of the S&P/TSX 60, and has a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange.

"DATA ANALYST - CX - Philadelphia, PA - Indeed.com","Customer Experience (CX) Data Analyst 
 
Evoke is a marketing and advertising agency servicing the healthcare industry. We partner with leading pharmaceutical, biotech, and medical device clients, consistently delivering unparalleled levels of strategic, creative, and technological innovation that build richer and more effective interactions between our clients and their customers. 
 
The Importance of CX & Data Analytics 
 
CX is a customers’ holistic perception of their experience of a brand. This perception is made up by every interaction a customer has with the brand, from navigating the website, to making a purchase, to engaging with customer service, and even to the delivery of the product itself. 
 
At Evoke, we believe that in order to fundamentally make health more human, we have to understand the CX. We have to understand the journeys of each core customer, looking for moments of friction, moments of frustration or moments where expectations are not met. By revealing these experiences, we are able to understand where to step in and create solutions that are truly meaningful, are often unique to a category, and ultimately create a seamless CX. 
 
Evoke is proud to have embraced the power of Big Data as a crucial mechanism to help us understand consumer attitudes, behaviors, and expectations. The macro data enables us to substantiate findings in the CX as well as generate new ways to understand human behavior. 
 
To help us accomplish this we are looking to add a full-time CX Data Analyst to the team here at Evoke. The ideal hire should have strong skills across all aspects of data analytics and research, including mining, cleaning, clustering, analysis, and visualization. The candidate should also showcase ease of conveying complex data into readable, goal-oriented outputs. 
 
 
Job Description 
 
 
At Evoke, the CX Data Analyst anchors the research to a scientific methodology, but continuously creates new ways to analyze the data. The role is not a copy-paste-print-present type of position, where the same report needs to be refreshed every quarter. Instead, the Evoke CX Data Analyst is challenged with Journey Mapping, Voice of Customer Analysis, Key Business Questions (KBQs), Audience Behavior, and much more. It’s this versatile breath of analysis that requires someone who’s willing to continuously explore, experiment, and learn, yet deliver a project on time while taking ownership. 
 
The CX Data Analyst would predominantly be working with text-based data, analyzing hundreds of thousands of data points to arrive at linguistic findings. These insights will often align against KBQs provided by CX Strategy and other team-members. Therefore, the CX Data Analyst needs to have a strong collaborative nature and enjoy teaming up on projects so that it may reach its full potential. The CX Data Analyst should always want to go “one level deeper” asking “Why did the consumer do that?” or “Why does the consumer thing this?” 
 
The CX Data Analyst will join a small team that has experienced strong growth providing research and solutions across a broad range of therapeutic areas and disease states. 
 
Specific duties include: 
 
 Work directly with other team-members (most often CX Strategy) to conduct Linguistic Analysis and NLP Research across Journey Mapping, Voice of Customer Analysis, Competitive Gap Analysis, Search Behavior Summary Social Media Listening, New Business Pitch Support etc. 
 Execute data mining, identifying optimal data sources, extracting data, connect to APIs or building data scrapers 
 Execute data cleaning, understanding best practices, and leverage Python to pre-processes for analysis 
 Execute data clustering across different data sources to combine a more robust dataset 
 Execute data clustering against specific rules to establish relevant subsets of data 
 Execute data analysis using several research techniques with a focus on NLP (examples below):
 Top volume across clustered search terms 
 Top volume across topics/terms/n-grams/sentiment/emojis used on social 
 Top sources of influence across channels, forums, blogs, news, SERP, accounts, products etc. 
 Longitudinal content relevance 
 Audience language analysis 
 Execute data visualization across Excel and Python leveraging packages such as Seaborn, matplotlib, Plotly, Bokeh or others 
 Craft a story from the data, conveying complex insights in simple visuals and communicate the takeaways with ease 
 Help develop new research offerings and outside the box solutions for both internal and external purposes 
 Continuously consider automation and optimization across current research streams and projects 
 Keep current on best practices for data analytics; emerging trends, channels, technologies, platforms, and partners; and innovative programs and approaches 
 
 
Skills / Qualifications: 
 
 2+ years in data analytics, specifically working with text-based data (search, social, reviews, news, transcripts, white papers, articles, excerpts etc.) 
 1+ years of agency experience preferred, but not required 
 Healthcare/pharmaceutical marketing preferred, but not required 
 Python proficiency required 
 Experience mining, cleansing, clustering, analyzing and visualizing data

Pearl Health is restoring the independence and joy of practicing medicine for doctors in America. Our healthcare system has burdened our doctors with too much process, while removing them from what they do best: caring for those we love most. We are a team of physicians (Groups), physician-enablement experts (VillageMD, Steward, Stellar) and technologists (athenahealth, TrialSpark, Flatiron Health) and health plan leaders (Oscar, Clover, Centivo) who believe that primary care providers (PCPs) are the key to America's future health. Our investors include Andreessen Horowitz and AlleyCorp.

"Senior Business Analyst - Chicago, IL 60604 - Indeed.com","If you have read my job descriptions before, welcome back. If you are new, welcome to the party....you will notice that I like to add humor to my job descriptions...so you will see (hopefully) some chuckles as you read this. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Tom. I am Partner & VP at RSM Solutions, Inc. About 95% of my time is spent 'customer facing'. That being said, I am going to be far more interested in 'fit' than anything else...a fit for you and a fit for the client. This also means that their are no 'layers' between me and any of my clients as well..I am direct to all my clients. That social 'fit' for this role is almost as important as the technical fit for this role. So, what creates that 'fit'...well, I'm glad you asked. Here are some of those components: This role will sit in a relatively small team (a team of 3 including yourself)...so, that ability to function well in a small team and coordinate cross-functionally (yep, I know you see that word a lot) will be important. You will be working at a global law firm...and that ability to speak to anyone at anytime will be critical to success. I know this may sound simple, but that ability to - as Steven Covey said so many years ago - 'first seek to understand then to be understood' is a skill that will be critical to success here. This is not a drama filled environment similar to 'Homeland' or a bureaucratic one like 'Parks and Rec'...this is not an environment where people who believe the entire planet revolves around them will succeed...their are no 'instagram influencers' here. So, you probably get my point...if you are an easy going individual that functions well in an environment where everyone gets there work done, you will work out just fine. This role is now being done onsite for 3 days a week. The other 2 days of the week can be done remotely. The location is 230 South LaSalle. For this role, I am only considering candidates that are in the Chicago area already. I can understand that people can relocate...but, for this role, we are only seeking candidates that are already in the Chicago area or are already relocating to Chicago. The official 'title' of this role is 'Practice and Client Solutions Analyst'. The closest title for this role is really a Senior Business Analyst. This role is something of hybrid of business analyst, systems analyst, as well as a project manager. You will be working across multiple teams in this law firm and will be something of a 'relationship manager' with the firm. This is the kind of environment where you can try things and come up with innovative approaches...even if you fail, you will learn something. When I say 'innovative approaches' I mean taking a look at what problem needs to be solved and working backward from there. From a technology standpoint, for example, they have been dabbling with the world of PowerApps...so, that may be a solution to some of the issues you will tackle. The reason I mention 'relationship manager' is because we really need a 'trainers personality'...you will be working with people who may (or may not) have the same technical acumen that you have... You will be working on improving and supporting the delivery of legal services by conceptualizing, designing, developing (the development will really focus on low code / no code applications) and delivering effective practice and client support applications. This role will also provide assistance in evaluating “buy-or-build” options, recommending the optimal solution and providing design and configuration assistance for its successful implementation. Responsibilities: Examine, analyze and document current business processes. Make recommendations for improving quality and/or increasing efficiency within practice operations. Consult with lawyers and business professionals, to understand and document the issues they face; and conceptualize, design, develop and deliver effective practice and client support applications – client focused technologies – focusing on delivering progressive quick-to-deliver solutions. Develop and deliver solutions using low-code/no-code, AI and other related development tools and technologies (for example, Power Apps and SharePoint). If you haven't developed in the Power Platform or SharePoint, however, the zombie apocalypse wont happen...that ability to learn will be of more importance...or, if you have dabbled in the world of Power Apps and SharePoint, that would be fine as well. Facilitate engagement within IT on the onboarding, maintenance and integration of technology applications. Formally document business, functional, and technical requirement specifications, requirements traceability matrices (RTMs), use cases, storyboards, workflow diagrams, and data flow diagrams. This will include fun stuff like development and documentation of user requirements, gap analysis, potential solution options, logical information models, user flows, wireframes, and necessary documentation as required on initiatives. Act as a liaison between legal/business colleagues, development teams, and technology experts communicating system requirements to system analysts and engineers and building trusting, collaborative relationships. Participate in Proof-of-Concept (PoC) evaluations of new and/or emerging technologies. Support the administration of firm’s external-facing collaboration platforms, currently Accellion, AMS, HighQ, Microsoft Teams and DocuSign. Qualifications A university degree, or equivalent work experience, preferably in legal or legal tech industry. At least 7 years of experience in business analysis and solution design. This experience will need to be in a legal environment. I can understand people can transition from pharma, manufacturing or finance to the legal vertical, but this hiring manager is really only interviewing candidates that have worked in the legal vertical. Experience with project management, preferably using Agile methodologies. From a technical standpoint, we would like to see at least some experience with HTML, The Microsoft Power Platform (PowerBI, PowerApps, etc), Tableau, and Python. However, the world is not going to come to an end if you don't have all of these things...just let me know what you have and what you don't. Exposure to data visualization applications and Working knowledge of design tools for storyboarding (Balsamiq, Omnigraffle, TFS StoryBoarding, etc.) would be great to see. Strong written and verbal communication skills, able to communicate effectively and in a professional manner with all levels of the Firm and outside vendors.'

Home Care Assistance began in 2002 when the founders noticed a lack of high-touch, premium care management and caregiving assistance when seeking to help their own loved one age successfully at home.
