As a software engineer working on the web console, you will: 
Work with friendly, engaged engineers and designers to build a fast and accessible web interface to the Oxide platform. 
Understand customer use cases and help define the Oxide product. Decisions about the console have consequences all the way down the stack. 
Write a lot of TypeScript and a little Rust. Rust experience is not required; interest goes a long way. 
Debug backend code when it's not doing what you expect, and even fix it yourself. 
Write tooling to help the team move faster. 
Learn about all layers of the stack exposed to users through the web: fault-tolerant distributed systems and databases that support virtual machines, virtual storage devices, and virtual networks. 
Code without fear, supported by continuous builds, tests, a constructive code-review process, and a supportive culture of identifying and fixing bugs. 
These responsibilities are just a starting place! We’re a small company, we don’t have rigid roles, and we have a lot to do – we can help you grow wherever your interests take you. 
You will thrive in this role if you: 
Write solid JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 
Approach development with rigor and a product mindset. 
Use libraries judiciously and avoid frontend architecture antipatterns. 
Know one of the major web SPA frameworks. React experience is helpful but not required. 
Believe in fully documenting your ideas. 
Enjoy reading the documentation produced by others. 
Get excited about a wide range of technical topics and dig really deep into them. 
Don’t mind coworkers getting really excited about decades-old computer front panels. 
If you don’t meet 100% of these qualifications you should still seriously consider applying! We all come from different backgrounds with different skills. 
Life at Oxide 
We are very explicit about our values, and they can be seen in daily life at Oxide, for example: 
Our rigor means we enjoy and take pride in the craft of engineering. 
Our urgency means that we are not above the judicious short-cut. 
Our versatility is reflected in our greatest strength: the breadth of our team. 
Our transparency can be seen in our consensus-driven RFD process. 
Our responsibility means that we both lead and follow: we have our own domains, but we also help others on their parts. 
Our curiosity shows in our insatiable desire to learn – and our empathy in our love of teaching others. 
Our humor is a big part of our daily lives: we are inveterate wise-crackers whose video meetings spill into simultaneous text chat. 
Our values also manifest themselves in our benefits: 
Everyone makes $180,250, regardless of location. 
We offer the best health insurance we could find: medical PPO plan, dental, and vision that are 100% covered for both employees and dependents. 
We are very supportive of remote work. About half of our team is outside of the San Francisco Bay Area; our only requirement is working hours with a significant overlap with Pacific Time. 
Our families and lives outside of our jobs are very important to us; our schedules are flexible to reflect and support that."

Software Developer - Early Career/Entry Level - Remote - Indeed.com,"Description 
Want to jump start your coding career? Looking to advance by joining and learning from a team of seasoned, high-performing software engineers? Do you want to support one of the most exciting and fun-filled industries in the world? 
At Gateway Ticketing Systems, Inc. you can kick off your career by supporting some of the largest theme parks, zoos, aquariums, and all the other awesome places you loved to visit as a kid. Not only will you be helping these amazing industries, but you will also have the opportunity to expand your skill set with some of best software developers you will ever meet. 
We have an immediate need for early career software developers. It starts with focusing on core skills while contributing to the team and the software. And before you run away, that is not code for “find the spelling mistakes on labels and fix them.” That means creating and expanding client side applications to test API service layers, writing load and performance tests for responsive design web applications, and code based regression tests for Windows applications. 
The exact development languages and tools you know are less important to us than your passion for technology, drive to get things done and ability to learn and absorb new ideas and concepts like a sponge. The opportunities for early career software developers at Gateway are limitless and joining our team would offer amazing career and development coaching from some of the best software developers you'll ever meet. 
In our product development group, software developers have the opportunity to grow via several layers of development positions, starting at an early career and moving up to senior and architect roles. 
Our philosophy with bringing in new software developers is to start with the core of what makes great developers great. We want you to learn and master the fundamental concepts that will feed your growth for the rest of your career. With this philosophy you'll be able to learn and absorb whatever comes to you. We all know technology changes fast, but the ability to learn, think fast, and apply core principles will last a lifetime. 
We firmly believe in a ""get your feet wet"" philosophy over a ""throw them in the deep end"" method of integrating new, early career members into our team. 
In support of that, you will start off by learning what our software does and how we do it by supporting our automation testing effort. When you read the words ""automated testing"", don't think of click and record kind of tasks, that's not what we do at all. When we write automated tests, we're building real, solid, production worthy code using all the core fundamentals of OOP that we all know and love. It's really writing code and it's writing it using the tools and languages we use in building our world class production software. The code that you write will run daily for every new build of our software. The speed at which you move up in the organization is only limited by your dedication, hard work and ability to get things done. 
 
 Key Responsibilities 
Learn to operate in our skilled and highly dedicated team, including our tools, processes and the software that we build. 
Maintain our current suite of automated regression, performance and load tests by monitoring automation runs and doing root cause analysis of problems. 
Build new automated tests on a variety of platforms and technologies: 
Automated testing on modern responsive design web applications 
Automated testing on modern Windows desktop applications 
API server layer testing by building client side applications to consume and test service applications 
Requirements 
A solid basis to start your learning process from. While the position is early career we are looking for team members with a solid foundation to build upon. This foundation could be from a formal education, prior work experience or self-taught. When you come in to meet us, this is what we will focus on, and don't be surprised when we ask you to write some code. 
A desire to work hard, focus and get things done. 
The ability to work well in a team environment and willingness to help others. 
Diversity and EEO statement: 
As an organization, we strive to maintain an environment and culture where all voices and perspectives are valued, where all team members are seen and heard, where opportunities are available to all who seek them, and where all employees feel they are able to bring their authentic selves to work each day. Diversity, equity and inclusion are an organizational priority, and we are committed to further building and strengthening these programs each year.

"Software Developer - Alpharetta, GA 30022 - Indeed.com","About Profisee Profisee exists to empower the possibilities of the data-enabled future. In a world where data drives decisions, opportunity and innovation, the importance trusted data simply cannot be overstated. Because when data matters, you must be able to trust your data and Master Data Management (MDM) is the path that forward thinking organizations take to ensure a trusted data foundation. The Master Data Management (MDM) market is listed modestly at $2B and has only been 10% penetrated. Profisee is quickly grabbing share of this market as we are disrupting old MDM ways by dismantling MDM perceptions of complexity and cost. We are building an enduring company and a platform that emphasizes the value of the data-enabled future. Built for fast growth, we value high-energy, integrity and trusted collaboration. In addition, Profisee was selected as one of Atlanta’s Top Places to Work in 2021 by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. You will become part of an amazing culture with a supportive CEO and smart teammates who want to see you progress in your career. * Position Summary: * Profisee is looking for an experienced Software Developer (3-5yrs) to join our R&D team to help accelerate the value R&D delivers to our customers, partners, and internal stakeholders by delivering innovative new features that will strengthen Profisee’s position as a leader in the MDM space. Profisee is a growing Microsoft gold-certified partner focused on data management solutions in general and, more specifically, in the area of Master Data Management. We work with leading-edge technology and you will have the opportunity to develop your skills as a full-stack engineer working on both web front-end, business tier, and data tier in both an on-premise as well as cloud technology environment. The Software Developer will report to one of our 3 Development Team Leads,  and work out of Profisee’s headquarters in Alpharetta, GA . You will work within a development team alongside other development and QA peers. * Performance Objectives: * * Primary Objective: * Contributing to the design, development and delivery of new features in the Profisee Platform. This begins by working with your team lead and team members to understand new feature requirements, including their underlying business drivers and benefits. Once understood, work with other developers, team leads and architects to design new features and decompose them into user stories. For stories assigned to you, work to check-in completed user stories, including the technical implementation with supporting unit tests, and then collaborate with QA on testing and resolution of any bugs. * Secondary Objective: * Contribute to Profisee’s R&D team by bringing new knowledge, experience and ideas to the team, driving individual and team growth. Profisee has a number of newer college graduates, and you will need to be capable of mentoring less experienced members of the team, helping them grow as technologists and team members. At the same time, you should be excited to collaborate with others on the team with different experiences and perspectives to grow your own skillset and capabilities. * Long-Term Objective: * Grow into Senior Software Developer with further options to transition to a Development Team Lead or Software Architect within R&D. As we continue to grow R&D, we will form additional development teams to prevent individual teams from becoming too large. Developers demonstrating strong engineering and planning skills will be natural candidates to take on a Team Lead or Software Architect roles. * Technical Leadership: * As a Software Developer, you should able to write high quality software across the technology stack – web and desktop UI, services, and database tier - following best practices such as clean architecture principles with minimal oversight, and contribute to development process improvements over time through collaboration with the broader team. To do so, you should be able to leverage knowledge gained from formalized education as well as past experiences delivering software solutions. As a new member of the team, you will need to become productive quickly by rapidly understanding the current architecture and code base of the Profisee Platform, developed using C#, .NET, and SQL Server, so that you can start developing user stories within the first 60 days. * Be Innovative: * Help Profisee push the envelope around technology innovation in the area of Master Data Management software. Profisee is evolving our software architecture towards a cloud-native architecture deployed using containers and micro-services. Developers must be eager to tackle new technologies and challenges we encounter along that journey, including the delivery of new components as micro-services, or breaking existing components out as they’re evolved to the new micro-services architecture. Developers must be willing to continually learn, evaluate and propose new technologies and approaches which can be used to deliver innovative features in the product. * Be Agile: * Profisee employs an Agile methodology for software development. Everyone in R&D should be comfortable working within an Agile software development environment. As a Software Developer, you should be actively participating in all aspects of the Agile lifecycle, including sprint planning, story writing, story pointing, daily standups, and reviews and retrospectives. * Learn & Grow: * Profisee’s culture values what we refer to as the “Growth Mindset” which supports the notion that we can learn and do anything if we put our mind to it. Our capacity to grow both professionally and personally is unlimited. If you want to be surrounded by a team that believes in and supports your ability to challenge yourself and, occasionally make mistakes as long as we learn from them, then Profisee is the place for you. You’ll be supported in keeping your skills current and sharing your knowledge through our , sprint reviews, and book clubs where like-minded Developers explore new and emerging technologies. Local (Georgia, USA) candidates only; no relocation * Company Values* The candidate should be aware that Profisee takes Core Values very seriously; they are not just words on a wall. We live by them everyday and want to attract like mind thinkers. Profisee is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace dedicated to pursuing and hiring a diverse workforce. We want candidates of all human varieties, background and lifestyles. There’s no problem that can’t be made better by bringing together people with a broader set of perspectives.

There are no limits and we accept mistakes as a part of growing and trying new things. This is one of the things that makes work, life, and our environment both fun and rewarding. * Constructive * Candor * - Everyone feels comfortable voicing their opinions and knows how each other feels when we leave a room. This enables us to get to the heart of issues quickly; hopefully disagreeing at times and enjoying diverse perspectives with the purpose of finding the best answer, not defending our own.* * Helpful: *Strives to assist, mentor, coach and assist your fellow Profisors to their highest potential and for them to be successful in every endeavor. Always has time to lend a hand, answer a question or share knowledge with your fellow employees as a matter of normal business and not as an exception. * Get Stuff Done: *Successfully completes crucial aspects of deliverables with a hands-on approach, including personal correspondence written and verbal, and other tasks that facilitates the CEO’s ability to effectively lead the company. Prioritizes conflicting needs; handles matters expeditiously, proactively, and follows-through on projects to successful completion, often with deadline pressures. * Fun is Where * Fun is Made -  Professional life is as enjoyable and rewarding as we make it. We covet the journey as much as the destination and strive to make each other laugh along the way. * Equal Employment Opportunity* To provide equal employment and advancement opportunities to all individuals, employment decisions at the Company will be based on merit, qualifications, and abilities.

As a software engineer working on the web console, you will: 
Work with friendly, engaged engineers and designers to build a fast and accessible web interface to the Oxide platform. 
Understand customer use cases and help define the Oxide product. Decisions about the console have consequences all the way down the stack.

These responsibilities are just a starting place! We’re a small company, we don’t have rigid roles, and we have a lot to do – we can help you grow wherever your interests take you. 
You will thrive in this role if you: 
Write solid JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Our rigor means we enjoy and take pride in the craft of engineering. 
Our urgency means that we are not above the judicious short-cut. 
Our versatility is reflected in our greatest strength: the breadth of our team. 
Our transparency can be seen in our consensus-driven RFD process. 
Our responsibility means that we both lead and follow: we have our own domains, but we also help others on their parts. 
Our curiosity shows in our insatiable desire to learn – and our empathy in our love of teaching others.

VMware Tanzu GemFire is a distributed, in-memory, and transactional datastore designed to provide very high throughput with predictable latency. GemFire is built on Apache Geode and is deployed throughout the world by demanding customers serving mission-critical applications in financial, telecommunications, retail, and transportation industries. 
The GemFire team tackles the technical challenges that come with massively parallel distributed systems operating on terabytes of data across hundreds of nodes. We delve into areas like query optimization, high-performance in-memory transaction and query processing, parallel and distributed execution of advanced data processing algorithms, resource management, and storage. On this team, you'll be working on hard, worthwhile problems with a collaborative team, accelerating your growth as an engineer. 
What is the primary need or problem you will be responsible for? 
As the industry shifts to Kubernetes and Cloud Native applications, we are improving our platform offerings of Tanzu GemFire in that environment. We are also adapting the core Tanzu GemFire itself to the challenges that face a high-performance data product on Kubernetes. At the same time we are providing enhancements and solving problems for our customers on our existing products. 
Within the first 6-12 months, what are the 2-3 most important performance goals I would be expected to complete for you to consider me successful in this role? 
Understand the feature set of GemFire, its support for different platforms and client libraries. 
Develop an area of expertise within our product (e.g. querying, function execution, cluster membership, Kubernetes operator) in which you can pick up most new feature work or most issues without guidance. 
You take an active role in design discussions and pull-request reviews for your area of expertise and are generally able to follow discussions outside of it. 
What type of work will you be doing? What assignments, requirements, or skills will you be performing on a regular basis? 
You will solve hard distributed systems problems. This might mean implementing new features and resolving customer issues on our Java-based data grid or our GoLang-based Kubernetes offering. You will be testing your work end-to-end and consider failure modes, race conditions and performance. As you become more proficient, you’ll take on an increasing role in designing new solutions together with the rest of your team and our Tech Leads. You will propose changes to the Apache Geode community and help others around you grow through hands-on mentorship and actionable pull request feedback. 
What is the leadership like for this role? What is the structure and culture of the team like? 
Across the Caching program we have a highly collaborative team that spans several time zones. We believe in the strength of a diverse team and that psychological safety allows all of us to do our best work. Our team and product have a long history, with some people having been on the team for decades. We believe that this is a testament to our culture and diversity of the technical problems we solve on our product. You will never run out of new things to learn! Our teams accommodate a large variety of working styles, to enable everyone to contribute at their best.

VMware Tanzu GemFire is a distributed, in-memory, and transactional datastore designed to provide very high throughput with predictable latency. GemFire is built on Apache Geode and is deployed throughout the world by demanding customers serving mission-critical applications in financial, telecommunications, retail, and transportation industries. 
The GemFire team tackles the technical challenges that come with massively parallel distributed systems operating on terabytes of data across hundreds of nodes. We delve into areas like query optimization, high-performance in-memory transaction and query processing, parallel and distributed execution of advanced data processing algorithms, resource management, and storage. On this team, you'll be working on hard, worthwhile problems with a collaborative team, accelerating your growth as an engineer. 
What is the primary need or problem you will be responsible for? 
As the industry shifts to Kubernetes and Cloud Native applications, we are improving our platform offerings of Tanzu GemFire in that environment. We are also adapting the core Tanzu GemFire itself to the challenges that face a high-performance data product on Kubernetes. At the same time we are providing enhancements and solving problems for our customers on our existing products.

Understand the feature set of GemFire, its support for different platforms and client libraries. 
Develop an area of expertise within our product (e.g. querying, function execution, cluster membership, Kubernetes operator) in which you can pick up most new feature work or most issues without guidance. 
You take an active role in design discussions and pull-request reviews for your area of expertise and are generally able to follow discussions outside of it. 
What type of work will you be doing? What assignments, requirements, or skills will you be performing on a regular basis? 
You will solve hard distributed systems problems. This might mean implementing new features and resolving customer issues on our Java-based data grid or our GoLang-based Kubernetes offering. You will be testing your work end-to-end and consider failure modes, race conditions and performance. As you become more proficient, you’ll take on an increasing role in designing new solutions together with the rest of your team and our Tech Leads. You will propose changes to the Apache Geode community and help others around you grow through hands-on mentorship and actionable pull request feedback. 
What is the leadership like for this role? What is the structure and culture of the team like? 
Across the Caching program we have a highly collaborative team that spans several time zones. We believe in the strength of a diverse team and that psychological safety allows all of us to do our best work. Our team and product have a long history, with some people having been on the team for decades. We believe that this is a testament to our culture and diversity of the technical problems we solve on our product. You will never run out of new things to learn! Our teams accommodate a large variety of working styles, to enable everyone to contribute at their best.

Why you'll love this job 
Successful Software Developers at American Airlines excel in three key areas: 
Software Delivery 
Product Mindset 
Growth Mindset 
Software Development Teams at American Airlines find ways to improve daily work. This means taking an honest look at delivery metrics and asking what we will do to improve them. We expect a team to ask  ""why has our deployment frequency declined over the last month?""  and work towards a solution to improve the situation as a team, under their own direction. In short, we want everyone to invest in continually improving themselves and their ways of working, while achieving product success. 
You will engage in all aspects of the Product lifecycle and work to grow your skills in Lean Product Development. We expect our engineers to dig in and solve business problems as true partners. We love small solutions and collecting data to draw conclusions. 
To build new solutions and chase new hypotheses, our teams are constantly learning. We accept failures as learning experiences and use those experiences to build resiliency in our systems.

Work with the delivery manager to identify training and growth opportunities. Recommend personal growth paths in conjunction with Delivery Manager. 
Help articulate and eliminate team blockers with the Delivery Manager (as needed). 
Participate in architecture and software design with the Squad - in general, encourages the team to work on new ideas and emergent, iterative design. Focuses on constructively arguing against solutions that are not a fit, if necessary. 
Partners with the Product Owner (presenting Playback, keeping focus on business value, etc.) as needed to support the overall Squad's delivery.

 How We Work 
Freedom and Flexibility:  At Loom, we believe work is an act, not a place. When we disengage work from a location, we can accommodate a broad range of life choices. You can choose to work from home or while you travel. If you are in the Bay Area, you can drop by our San Francisco office on 2nd and Market St. when reopens in Fall 2021. We are able to hire across the United States and Canada* and are continuing to expand our international presence. And you are free to move within a country without any adjustment to compensation. 
Engaging Workday:  The key to an engaging workday is finding the right balance between different ways to work sync, async, text and video. Loom makes it easier for us to say what we mean without having to schedule a zoom meeting or struggle to find the right words. And using async communication allows us to free up time for deep work every day. We believe there's a place for sync time - often a conversation on Zoom is exactly what is needed. For team meetings, this ‘sync time’ is typically between 9AM-Noon PT given where the overlap of timezones where Loommates are located. 
Work-Rest Balance:  The way we balance the fast-paced demands of a high-growth startup and sustainability is making rest a priority. We offer a flexible PTO policy so you're able to take time off when you need it. We also go fully offline once a year between Christmas and New Year (and twice during the Pandemic). Rest is also part of the workday, not just during PTO. Taking a break for personal commitments, whether it's watching the kids or getting some exercise is natural part of the workday. 
Social Connection:  Relationships and connectedness matter. We are intentional about building trust and relationships through unique, shared experiences. Our virtual workspace keeps us connected day-to-day whether it's through Looms celebrating wins or our buzzing Slack communities. Post-COVID, we want Loommates to meet in person at least twice a year purely for fun. We're also experimenting in local offices as social spaces, starting with San Francisco in Fall 2021.

Why Cisco
 #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an expansive future for all.
 We adopt digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns , and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
 But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
 Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
 So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!"

About the Department 
 
The Workers team makes it possible for Cloudflare customers to run JavaScript and WebAssembly on Cloudflare's edge network.

You will own your code from inception to release, delivering solutions at all layers of the software stack to empower Cloudflare customers. On any given day, you might write a design document that outlines how you plan to solve a specific problem, modify how the Worker's runtime processes requests, update the configuration plane to enable routing a user's scripts to the edge, or fix a bug in how our user experience renders.

 Experience managing and contributing to open-source projects. 
 Experience embedding a scripting language in a product. 
 Experience writing code in a modern front end framework such as React or AngularJS.

Project Galileo : We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare's enterprise customers-at no cost. 
 
Athenian Project : We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration. 
 
Path Forward Partnership : Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one. 
 
1.1.1.1 : We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here's the deal - we don't store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

Why Cisco
 #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an expansive future for all.
 We adopt digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns , and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
 But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
 Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
 So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!"

"Software Engineer, Payment Connections - Atlanta, GA - Indeed.com","Company Description 
Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place. 
Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together. 
There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same. 
 
 Job Description 
As a Software Engineer on the Payment Connections team, you will be responsible for designing, building, and maintaining the payment services and infrastructure that move money for Square.

You will: 
Work on a team that handles the processing of billions of global payments for Square using a high availability architecture. 
Translate financial platform specifications into APIs used by Square teams to move money accurately. 
Write testable, maintainable code from design to production considering monitoring, scalability, and operational tooling. 
Evolve accepted payment methods across Square products to ensure our customers never miss a sale. 
Implement high-volume, low-latency, distributed transaction processing systems 
Build systems that manage customers’ sensitive data and hold Square to the highest standards for security and compliance 
Work cross-functionally with our product, business, and finance teams to develop Square’s global payments strategy 
 
 Qualifications 
You have: 
Ability to create effective code independently while working with a high-performing team of engineers 
Innate curiosity and a desire to be responsible for all aspects of reliably moving transactions worth billions of dollars in a small, highly focused team 
Understanding and curiosity in creating highly available, scalable, low-latency, global systems 
Interest in changing the payments landscape in the US and globally 
Bachelor's degree or relevant industry experience and 2+ years of software development experience in Java, C++, Go or similar

This includes systems to detect very challenging threats, as well as radar imagery, and advanced countermeasures to degrade the performance of adversary radar systems. Lincoln Laboratory is a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), whose core mission is technology in support of national security. As such, the role of the lab is to provide objective advice and to provide the best solutions to the government, not simply promoting our own systems. The group works at every stage of radar sensor development, from designing operational concepts with pen and paper studies to gathering real world data, developing novel processing techniques, building hardware prototypes, developing test plans, demonstrating real time operations and working with operational platforms to deploy new techniques in the field. This requires a team with a broad range of backgrounds, and our team includes scientists familiar with sensing systems, mathematicians who can develop algorithms, hardware engineers who can build RF systems. Our group seeks a diverse set of technical and non-technical backgrounds, emphasizing creative problem solving and a “design it – build it – test it” approach to radar challenges. Staff have opportunities to design and build end-to-end working systems and test those systems on one of our two aircraft testbeds. This position is ideal for mathematicians, engineers and scientists who have curiosity and a broad range of interest, and a talent for determining what really drives a problem. Lincoln Laboratory maintains a relatively flat structure, and staff are empowered to propose and run technical programs on their own initiative with support of management.

Job Description 
 
We are looking for a talented programmer to join our airborne radar development and experimentation team. Many of our projects start with data collection and algorithm development in high level languages like Matlab or Python, but then transition to real-time implementation in a more performant language such as C++.

 Embedded system control Real-time signal processing Machine Learning implementations Radio Frequency hardware initialization and diagnostics Test automation Intra and inter-system communications User interfaces 
 
We expect our engineers to be flexible, innovative, and highly collaborative in our fast paced development and test programs. Someone with a strong desire to continue to learn new things will find plenty of opportunities in our group.

Python Software Engineer (Staff or Senior level depending upon experience) – $75K-135K – Dallas, TX 
Summary: 
Are you “Python-centric” and does using Python to help maintain and enhance system performance for custom hardware and software platforms interest you? If so, we have a great opportunity to use your Python skills to support our critical warehouse and mobile device-related systems. In this role, you will help maintain the hardware and software for processing (shipping, receiving, and processing) returned connected devices. You will work with our Engineering and R&D teams to build cutting-edge integrated hardware platforms to further automate and enhance productivity, stability, and throughput. This is a great opportunity for those engaged by growth, challenge, connected devices, and robotics. Apply today to learn more! 
What you own (responsibilities):  We are agile, and so our days and duties can vary. In this role, you own and are responsible for delivering to your colleagues: 
Work primarily in Python to support critical software systems for our custom hardware and software platform. (e.g. Shipping and Receiving Stations) 
Enhance and debug Python applications 
Diagnose and solve issues in an Ubuntu Linux Desktop environment 
Help maintain the related software and work with our Engineering and R&D teams to improve user experience and throughput at our custom workstations 
Use Python and other systems and processes to enhance productivity, preserve stability, ensure consistent APIs, and enhance system speed. 
Use AWS CloudWatch to monitor and diagnose issues, and build alerts to notify stakeholders in real-time of issues occurring. 
What you bring (experience and qualifications):  We come together to deliver for each other and our customers, and we know there are many paths to performing well. We will expect you to come up to speed fast and deliver great work without too much guidance. We think it would be hard to do that in this job without specialized education or proven successful experience in: 
BS in Computer Science or related field with a Masters in Computer Science a plus 
Relevant experience may substitute for and/or augment relevant degrees 
2-8 years experience working with software in a production environment 
2+ years of Python experience and interest in designing, implementing, debugging, and testing experience required 
Experience working with software and hardware components for user facing applications 
Skills in SQL, Linux, Ansible, JavaScript, Arduino, Docker, or similar products 
Exposure to robotics and warehouse automation a plus 
Strong communications and problem-solving skills with an attention for detail 
If you think differently and know that you can do the job well, apply and show us! 
What we expect from everyone: 
What does it take to be successful with us? We expect ourselves and each other to: 
Put people first (by helping others be at their best-and making sure we are, too) 
Communicate clearly (by speaking candidly, regularly, and respectfully to everyone) 
Own our work and the outcomes (by taking personal ownership to deliver on the commitments we make to our colleagues and our customers) 
Trust and be trustworthy (by acting with integrity and providing excellent work for each other and our clients) 
Value everyone’s voice (because it’s all about the best ideas-not bureaucracy). 
What you can expect from us: 
4 weeks of time off every year. Most of it doesn't roll over because we know we won't use it otherwise - and we know using it makes us better at our work and to each other. 
Flexible working hours and schedules (some positions-like this one-will do some on-call weekend work on occasion, but we expect you to take time off during the week to make up for it) 
Casual dress 
A company-paid Google Pixel phone or a monthly credit to apply for your tech needs (including upgrading your bandwidth) 
12 paid holidays, including Juneteenth and the day after Thanksgiving 
A monthly wellness stipend that you can use for things like a meditation app, standing desk, gym equipment, etc. 
401(k) matching up to 4% 
Up to $5,250/year for certification, continuing education, and tuition reimbursement. 
Insurance coverage we’re proud of for you, your family, and your spouse or domestic partner. We pay 100% of the cost of coverage for you for vision (through VSP), dental (through Guardian Dental), and some medical plans (through United Health Care, the largest health insurance company in the U.S.). 
HSAs, FSAs (health care, dependent care), and commuter benefits to reduce what you have to pay for these parts of your life 
The fine print: 
You also must be able to travel as needed (roughly 0-5% of your time). Potential travel locations include customer sites in and around the DFW area, Nashville, or to our corporate headquarters in Baltimore or to other sites as we grow. In general, this is not a travel-centric role. 
The physical requirements include prolonged periods sitting at a desk and working on a computer (though you can use the tech benefit to create whatever desk you’ll work best at). 
We are an agile organization, and so the duties and description of this role (like every other at Apkudo) may change at any time as we adapt. 
This position is exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)."

Software Engineer (PHP/Python) - Remote - Indeed.com,"The WebPageTest open-source team is responsible for ensuring the folks that use WebPageTest have a high-quality experience, from end-to-end. We build and maintain the testing agent that WebPageTest uses to record and collect data from the browser, as well as the server that processes those results and provides helpful analysis and visualizations. 
 
 About the opportunity 
In this role, you'll have the opportunity to plan and build features for the one of the most important tools in the web performance community, helping to push the performance of the web forward in the process. 
Here are some of the traits we're looking for in the role: 
Experience working with languages like PHP, Python and JavaScript. Our test agent is written in Python and the core server is written in PHP (with HTML, CSS and vanilla JS on the front-end, along with a sprinkling of jQuery). You don’t need to be an expert in all of these, having solid experience in a one or two with the curiosity and willingness to dive into the rest is what we’re after. 
Some familiarity with Redis, and a willingness to learn more, is a big plus. 
Experience working with browser internals or tracing is a big plus. Our agent programmatically drives Chrome, Safari and Firefox using a combination of WebDriver and a few extensions, and driving those browsers efficiently and accurately (accuracy of our data is one of the most important priorities for WebPageTest) is important. 
A willingness to iterate on an existing system while still shipping. Look—we won’t lie—there’s some cleanup we’d love to do. But we want to avoid a full-blown rewrite in favor of making iterative and meaningful improvements as we go. 
An eagerness for working in a collaborative environment with team members spread out around the world. 
A passion for web performance is not required (though it will be very helpful as we prioritize features and improvement), but wanting to empower and encourage developers to build a healthier, more resilient and more accessible web is kinda what we’re all about. 
Opinions, but balanced with humility and pragmatism. We’re not always gonna agree on the perfect way forward, but a variety of experiences and opinions, mixed with respect and kindness to those around you, is at the heart of what it means to build a good team. 
Comfortability engaging the community is key. The code for the agent and server is on GitHub and we get a fair amount of feedback and requests from the community. Being able to prioritize those requests, and work with the community to better understand them, is a core part of the role."

 Senior Software Engineer, Datastores
 Build the infrastructure powering work.
 Our Team
 Slack's Datastores team builds and operates the database platform powering Slack. We write software to manage thousands of stateful hosts, providing several petabytes of online database capacity. We are building one of the fastest-growing database platforms in the world. Our MySQL databases run in Vitess . You can read more about our migration to Vitess at: Scaling Datastores at Slack with Vitess
 Background
 Slack enables people all over the world to communicate and collaborate together. Teams of all scales — from the world’s largest public companies to the smallest of startups — use Slack to get work done, so we take performance and reliability very seriously. A taste of our scale:
 The average user spends over 10 hours connected and 2.5 hours active in Slack every single day
 1.5 billion+ messages are sent per month, half of those outside the United States
 Every day we see over 10M+ daily active users, over a billion web requests, and 10s of billions of database queries.
 For millions of people, Slack is the primary communication tool they use at work all day long. They expect it to be exceptionally reliable and fast, all the time .
 Infrastructure at Slack
 We operate at tremendous scale with systems that process millions of events per second. Teams in our group maintain and build the lower levels of our stack, including:
 Edge services
 Data Stores and Caches
 Real-time messaging
 Asynchronous background job processing
 We know we’ve done our job correctly when  none of our users think about us.  We don’t typically ship new user-facing features, but rather ensure our systems are incredibly performant, highly available, reliable, and scalable. In other words, Slack just works seamlessly.
 Slack's API and web backend is built on PHP/Hack , our backend services are written in Java and Go, and we use Vitess as our storage engine. Our architecture is constantly evolving to handle millions more users. You can read about how we scaled our datastores with Vitess , how we respond to incidents , and much more on our blog.
 If you were to join Slack, here the types of things you would do over the course of a typical week:
 Operate and enhance our large, highly-available database infrastructure, utilizing technologies such as MySQL and Vitess.
 Develop tools to enable self-service and self-managing capabilities of our database infrastructure so that other teams can operate full-stack while rapidly building new features for our customers.
 Collaborate with engineering teams on their database storage needs, and advise them throughout the development lifecycle.
 Write code to perform common database operations using our framework for automating ops tasks, then run your code across thousands of database instances.
 Participate in our on-call rotation and collaborate with our operations team to triage and resolve production issues.
 You may be a fit for this role if you:
 Have been working in data storage, core infrastructure, or distributed system-owning teams with increasing responsibilities for 5+ years.
 Have professional experience using Go, PHP/Hacklang, Python, Ruby, or Java.
 Operated at least one distributed system, at scale and in a team environment. Some examples include: a relational database like MySQL/Postgres, or systems like Kafka, Cassandra, or ElasticSearch.
 Write code that can be easily understood by others with an eye towards clarity and maintainability. Collaborate with other teams to integrate new features of your platform or adopt self-service features.
 Deployed server software on Linux, and then operated it at scale. You’ve debugged its problems, and analyzed and optimized its performance.
 Have experience operating cloud infrastructure, especially AWS.
 Are familiar with deployment automation/configuration management tools like Chef, Ansible, Puppet, or Terraform.
 Are a very strong communicator. You’re excited to explain complex technical concepts and share your knowledge with different audiences.
 Are curious how things work; when they break you are eager and able to help fix them.
 Infrastructure is a diverse and inclusive group that treats their colleagues exceptionally well. We are happy to help you learn what you need to know; we encourage and support each other’s growth and thus it’s not expected that you would have expertise across all of these areas.
 Come join us!
 Slack is registered as an employer in many, but not all, states. If you are not located in or able to work from a state where Slack is registered, you will not be eligible for employment.
 Visa sponsorship is not available for candidates living outside the country of this position.
