DESCRIPTION

In doing so the program will support the library as a place for community and scholarship by providing students with diverse, inclusive, accessible, safe and resource-rich physical and digital spaces that are centered on supporting the academic experience. Technology and Digital Experience is made up of distinct units that operate with strategic guidance from the program director, but objectives, deliverables, and unit strategy will be set by the unit managers. Given the cross-program nature of our work TDX will have roles in advisory groups that inform our digital library and digital user experience strategies.

This role will also step into new projects in collaborative open-source environments where peer review, pairing, and feedback will come from team members inside and outside of the department.
 Applies professional programming concepts for small to medium-sized projects or portions of larger projects. Resolves a variety of programming design and implementation issues. Works on programming assignments of moderate scope where analysis of situations or data requires a review of a variety of factors.

Full Stack Software Developer - Pennsylvania - Indeed.com,"Art+Logic is looking for developers to work with us on interesting custom software projects. We've been around since 1991, and we're still going strong. 
 
Our ideal developers thrive in the environment of variety and challenge that is inherent to custom software development, working with us in a long-term relationship over many projects for numerous clients. 
 
Since we do custom software development, the skills and needs for each project can vary widely. This goes beyond just the languages we use, to the industries and problem domains we work in. We look for generalists; most importantly those who are excited to learn and take on new challenges. You can expect to grow both in your strength and your versatility when working here. We want to help you do so. 
 
We work remotely all over North America. We expect you to be able to work well on your own and comfortably with teams. You won't have someone looking over your shoulder so you'll need to be communicative and reliable, and hold yourself accountable. We depend on each other. 
 
Art+Logic is run by humans, who work and create using technology. Things can go wrong and we need to respond to the unexpected by being kind, considerate, fair, flexible, and calm. We treat our clients and peers as respectfully as we would like to be treated. 
 
Here's an example of some projects we've worked on recently, so you can better understand the wide range of projects and challenges we undertake: 
 
 Implementing a Django-based DoD CAC card login 
 Writing a data model layer using SQLAlchemy to provide an object-oriented view of a legacy relational database schema. This model layer provides all business rules and data integrity using advanced python3 features. This data model in turn serves a REST API (python-pyramid) consumed by an advanced single-page web application written with Marionette (Backbone) 
 Created Windows tablet application to communicate with client's modbus hardware and upload data to Python/Django/Vue webapp for analysis and display 
 
 
What we want from you: (aka: skills) 
 
We are looking for people who are curious and looking for opportunities to learn. People who like learning and creating on their own. Those who are able to drive themselves or even lead others when completing projects. Developers who are able to organize and express their ideas. Communication is paramount here. 
 
Skills needed vary on the demand of the projects we're working on. Some skills we've recently had a high demand for include Python/Django, JavaScript/Vue, MacOS, and iOS. 
 
Relationship Details: 
 
We are looking for Contractors (1099) for long term open-ended relationships. Work hours are flexible; requiring reasonable overlap with normal working hours to support team communications, and not just nights and weekends. Our rates range from $40-$70/hour. (The top of that range reserved for Senior Software Developers/Project Managers.) We are ONLY looking for people in North America. 
 
We want you to enjoy working for us, and to be able to have a life outside of work. Since you're not commuting you can embrace the freedom of working from where you enjoy living, and use the saved time for your personal life and relationships. We don't ask our developers to work consistently over 40 hours/week. 
 
It's important to us in the hiring process that we allow developers to demonstrate their abilities by actually developing something, because a list of previous employers or educational background aren't always indicators of what someone can do. All applicants are asked to submit a solution to a programming challenge that emulates a task we might assign on a project."

Full Stack Software Developer - Pennsylvania - Indeed.com,"Art+Logic is looking for developers to work with us on interesting custom software projects. We've been around since 1991, and we're still going strong. 
 
Our ideal developers thrive in the environment of variety and challenge that is inherent to custom software development, working with us in a long-term relationship over many projects for numerous clients. 
 
Since we do custom software development, the skills and needs for each project can vary widely. This goes beyond just the languages we use, to the industries and problem domains we work in. We look for generalists; most importantly those who are excited to learn and take on new challenges. You can expect to grow both in your strength and your versatility when working here. We want to help you do so. 
 
We work remotely all over North America. We expect you to be able to work well on your own and comfortably with teams. You won't have someone looking over your shoulder so you'll need to be communicative and reliable, and hold yourself accountable. We depend on each other. 
 
Art+Logic is run by humans, who work and create using technology. Things can go wrong and we need to respond to the unexpected by being kind, considerate, fair, flexible, and calm. We treat our clients and peers as respectfully as we would like to be treated. 
 
Here's an example of some projects we've worked on recently, so you can better understand the wide range of projects and challenges we undertake: 
 
 Implementing a Django-based DoD CAC card login 
 Writing a data model layer using SQLAlchemy to provide an object-oriented view of a legacy relational database schema. This model layer provides all business rules and data integrity using advanced python3 features. This data model in turn serves a REST API (python-pyramid) consumed by an advanced single-page web application written with Marionette (Backbone) 
 Created Windows tablet application to communicate with client's modbus hardware and upload data to Python/Django/Vue webapp for analysis and display 
 
 
What we want from you: (aka: skills) 
 
We are looking for people who are curious and looking for opportunities to learn. People who like learning and creating on their own. Those who are able to drive themselves or even lead others when completing projects. Developers who are able to organize and express their ideas. Communication is paramount here. 
 
Skills needed vary on the demand of the projects we're working on. Some skills we've recently had a high demand for include Python/Django, JavaScript/Vue, MacOS, and iOS. 
 
Relationship Details: 
 
We are looking for Contractors (1099) for long term open-ended relationships. Work hours are flexible; requiring reasonable overlap with normal working hours to support team communications, and not just nights and weekends. Our rates range from $40-$70/hour. (The top of that range reserved for Senior Software Developers/Project Managers.) We are ONLY looking for people in North America. 
 
We want you to enjoy working for us, and to be able to have a life outside of work. Since you're not commuting you can embrace the freedom of working from where you enjoy living, and use the saved time for your personal life and relationships. We don't ask our developers to work consistently over 40 hours/week. 
 
It's important to us in the hiring process that we allow developers to demonstrate their abilities by actually developing something, because a list of previous employers or educational background aren't always indicators of what someone can do. All applicants are asked to submit a solution to a programming challenge that emulates a task we might assign on a project."

We've built an end-to-end logistics and supply chain platform, enabling us to offer consumers a much more convenient solution at price parity with the incumbents. We've raised $300M from a number of VCs, including Softbank, Sequoia Capital, Atomico and GV (formerly Google Ventures). We have 750+ team members and tens of thousands of customers in 7 major markets across the US with plans to be in 50+ markets, domestically and internationally, within the next 5 years.

 Experience building highly scalable web and mobile applications in an agile environment. 
 Ability to adapt and learn quickly in a constantly-evolving environment. 
 Experience working in supply chain, logistics, e-commerce, payments, or monetization platforms is a plus. 
 
 What we offer: 
 
 Competitive base salary 
 Equity - you'll receive an initial stock option grant as well as the ability to earn additional stock options each quarter

"Android, Mobile Engineer, Apprenticeship (Remote) - Illinois - Indeed.com","What we're building and why we're building it. 
 
 Fetch is a build-first technology company creating a rewards program to power the world. Over the last 5 years, we've grown from 0 to 11M active users and taken over the rewards game in the US with our free app. The foundation has been laid. In the next 5 years we will become a global platform that completely transforms how people connect with brands. 
 
It all comes down to two core beliefs. First, that people deserve to be rewarded when they create value. If a third party directly benefits from an action you take or data you provide, you should be rewarded for it. And not just the ""you get to use our product!"" cop-out. We're talkin' real, explicit value. Fetch points, perhaps. 
 
Second, we also believe brands need a better and more direct connection with what matters most to them: their customers. - Brands need to understand what people are doing, and have a direct line to be able to do something about it. Not just advertise, but ACT. Sounds nice right? 
 
That's why we're building the world's rewards platform. A closed-loop, standardized rewards layer across all consumer behavior that will lead to happier shoppers and stronger brands. 
 
Fetch Rewards is an equal employment opportunity employer. 
 
The Role! 
 
Fetch's next step in evolving the shopping experience will require growing the engineering team.

 An understanding of functional or object-oriented programming

Create software that will redefine the movement from physical to digital.  CartKit is positioned to create the most deeply integrated, leveraged and useful software for commerce in the digital space. 
Work with some of the best and brightest people in the world.  A team of 11 builds products used by over 30,000 businesses. We've achieved more than teams that are 10x our size by relentlessly focusing on first principles, recruiting world-class talent, and building in-house tech that allows us to magnify our output. 
Make an outsized impact.  Our team is still small and each team member wears many hats. Get to participate in every phase of the process — from inception, to planning, to implementation, to polish. Take ownership over not just code, but business outcomes. 
It's a magical time to join.  We're bootstrapped, profitable and have rapid growth opportunities ahead of us. Join us and shape the tools that are redefining digital commerce. 
About this Role 
So what will you do as a Full Stack Engineer @ CartKit? 
You'll build new products and features from start to finish. This would involve research, conception, planning, maintenance and polish. Think features that empower digital brands to sell more, such as new marketing channels and platform integrations. 
You'll build improvements to existing products and features, such as improving the performance and efficiency of our marketing campaign editor. 
You'll build and improve upon business operations and internal tooling — a large part of our efficiency comes from the internal tools and systems we've created — think setting up monitoring and internal dashboards. 
Is this a good fit for you? 
We're looking for world class talent that has energy, drive and a conviction to push digital commerce forward. This might be for you if... 
You excel at your craft — your work is well crafted and well tested. 
You have experience with scale — you've worked with companies that have experienced rapid growth and understand what it takes to reach the next level. 
You can readily learn — to you, tech is a means to an end. You're not married to any language, framework, or ideology. You use the right tech for the job and can learn new tech quickly. 
You care about business implications of the software that you build — you understand the balance between craft, speed and the bottom line. You understand that software is built first and foremost for customers. 
Bonus: You enjoy writing — you understand that clear writing is oxygen for a distributed team and take pride in clearly articulating your thoughts and ideas. 
Bonus: You've spent time as a senior engineer or tech lead. 
Bonus: You're fluent with Typescript, NodeJS, Postgres, Elasticsearch, Ruby on Rails, VueJS, React. 
Company Mission 
We want to empower digital businesses with the tools they need so that they can focus on what they do best: creating and selling their unique products and services. 
About CartKit 
CartKit's products are used by over 30,000 active businesses from over 150 countries. We're profitable and have doubled revenue year over year. We're bootstrapped and entirely distributed — find us in Colombia, Mexico, Pakistan, Poland, and the United States. 
We have a flat organizational structure; everyone is responsible and autonomous. We dislike bureaucracy and aim to eliminate operational inefficiencies. We don't believe in long meetings or formalities. 
We encourage the team to find the right balance between synchronous and asynchronous collaboration. Each team member is on a personal journey to maximize deep work, focus, creativity and impact. 
We believe in an idea meritocracy. We focus on adding value and building, getting work done in the best possible way, and making something greater than ourselves."

"Full Stack Developer - West Conshohocken, PA 19428 - Indeed.com","This position is in the development team that creates the visualization components for the Oracle Transportation Management (OTM) product. The position involves full-stack development with an emphasis on the front-end.
 
 
Global trading networks and supply chains depend upon efficient and well-organized logistics. Companies that manage the shipment of millions of orders want to reduce transportation costs, need to monitor the progress of shipments through global networks, and must provide visibility to shippers, customers, and service providers alike. A reduction in transportation costs of even 1% can lead to millions of dollars of savings per year.
 
 
Oracle Transportation Management (OTM) is a sophisticated transportation management system that allows just this type of functionality. OTM is a large software product typically used by large retailers (e.g., IKEA, Adeo), large manufacturers (e.g., Dell, GE), and large transportation companies (e.g., Schneider, DHL) to manage their transportation of goods. OTM has been first in the transportation management system (TMS) space for at least a decade. The US development office is in West Conshohocken PA (suburban Philadelphia); there is also a development team in Oracle's India Development Center (IDC). Overall, there are about 100 development team members (including developers, QA testers, documentation, etc.), split roughly half and half between the US office and IDC. This opening is located in West Conshohocken, PA.
 
 
Within the OTM Development team, the Planning team develops the sophisticated algorithms and optimization techniques that allow OTM to figure out how to reduce costs in a shipper's transportation network, as well as data visualization tools to help planners make informed transportation decisions. Within the Planning team, the Workbench group develops applications which visualize the entire supply chain in different views (Geographic Maps, Gantt charts, 3D container view, Network graphs) in a single page. This comprehensive solution can visualize the assets of a transportation network, diagnose restrictions and perform optimization on OTMâ€™s business objects. This integrated approach of displaying complex information helps in improving decision making and provides true and intelligent supply chain visibility. In other words, the Planning team is a good place for people who enjoy solving hard abstract problems and present complex data that are extremely relevant to the real world. As part of our team, you would:
 Be a part of an Agile development team enhancing our world class products
